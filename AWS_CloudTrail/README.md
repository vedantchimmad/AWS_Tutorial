# AWS CloudTrail

---
![CloudTrail](../Image/AWS_Cloudtrail.png)
* Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
* CloudTrail is enabled by default!
* Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
  * Console
  * SDK
  * CLI
  * AWS Services
* Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
* A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
* If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!
### CloudTrail Events
* Management Events:
  * Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
  * Examples:
    * Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
    * Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
    * Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
  * By default, trails are configured to log management events.
  * Can separate Read Events (that donâ€™t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources)
* Data Events:
  * By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)
  * Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events
  * AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)
* CloudTrail Insights Events:
  * See next slide 
### CloudTrail Insights
![CloudTrail Insights](../Image/CloudTrail_insights.png)
* Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
  * inaccurate resource provisioning
  * hitting service limits
  * Bursts of AWS IAM actions
  * Gaps in periodic maintenance activity
* CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
* And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns
  * Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
  * Event is sent to Amazon S3
  * An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)
### CloudTrail Events Retention

* Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
* To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena
